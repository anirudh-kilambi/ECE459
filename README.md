# ECE 459
This repository stores my lab code for the University of Waterloo's ECE 459 - programming for performance.

## MUST DO
All folders have the data folder zipped up to save space, you'll need to unzip them to run the code.

## Lab Work
To get more ideas on how each of the labs work, take a look at the `README.md` inside each lab's respective folder.

### Lab 1:
- You'll be screwing around a lot, I'd recommend just reading the `README` and deleting my implementations of functions if you wanna try yourself.

### Lab 2:
- This one was a lot more involved. I'd recommend reading my commit logs to understand my implementation, and then deleting my helper functions. Give it a try yourself.
